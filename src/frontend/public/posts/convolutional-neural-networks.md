# Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized computer vision by automatically learning hierarchical features from images. Unlike traditional methods that require manual feature engineering, CNNs learn optimal features directly from data.

## Architecture Overview

A typical CNN consists of several types of layers:

### Convolutional Layers

The convolution operation is the core building block:
