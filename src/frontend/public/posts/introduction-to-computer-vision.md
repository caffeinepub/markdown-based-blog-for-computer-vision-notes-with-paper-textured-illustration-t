# Introduction to Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they "see."

## What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision enables computers to see, observe and understand. It works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start. Human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart, how far away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.

## Key Components

### Image Processing

Image processing is the foundation of computer vision. It involves:

* **Filtering**: Removing noise and enhancing features
* **Edge Detection**: Identifying boundaries within images
* **Color Space Conversion**: Working with different color representations
* **Histogram Equalization**: Improving image contrast

### Feature Detection

Feature detection identifies interesting points in an image:

1. **Corner Detection**: Harris corner detector, FAST
2. **Blob Detection**: Difference of Gaussians (DoG)
3. **Edge Detection**: Canny edge detector, Sobel operator

### Classical Methods vs Deep Learning

**Classical Computer Vision** relied on hand-crafted features:
