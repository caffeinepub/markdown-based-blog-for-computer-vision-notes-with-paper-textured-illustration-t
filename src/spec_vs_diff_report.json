  "summary": "Diff updates TagFilterBar and tag rendering in PostCard and PostDetailPage to use new CSS hook classes (tag-chip, tag-chip-large, tag-filter-button, tag-filter-button-selected) while preserving click/navigation behavior. However, the diff summary does not show the corresponding CSS rules that would actually implement the requested dark-theme visuals and focus/hover accessibility states, so REQ-13’s styling acceptance criteria are not demonstrably met from the provided evidence.",

      "requirement": "Tag chips (PostCard + PostDetail) and TagFilterBar (including selected state and clear-filter button) should render with dark surfaces and readable light/off-white text, with clear selected/unselected distinction and retained hover/focus-visible keyboard styles.",
      "reason": "Components were changed to reference new classes (tag-chip, tag-chip-large, tag-filter-button, tag-filter-button-selected), but the diff summary does not include any CSS definitions for these classes, nor evidence of dark-surface/light-text styling, selected/unselected visual distinction styling, or hover/focus-visible styles that satisfy the acceptance criteria.",
